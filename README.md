Commiting so that Bruno will be remembered in Github forever.

Brumobile
=========

A javascript framework for building mobile web applications.

* MVC framework
* Plugin architecture
* Compatible with Zepto
* Compatible with <a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a> (using the phonegap.js plugin provided).
* Framework components (Router, Template Engine, Model, Animator, etc..) can be easily extended/replaced.

_This is not a fully-featured framework, it provides a clean project structure with basic components. 
Components and plugins can be managed and extended easily._

_It is designed mainly for PhoneGap applications, though it works also in the browser (but the lazy loading of all the modules
at runtime should be avoided in a producion browser-based environment by bundling the code in an unique file)._

__Contributors__

* [bfil](https://github.com/bfil)

_Contributors for plugins are welcome._


Dependencies
------------

The core framework dependencies are:

* Zepto or jQuery (default is Zepto)
* Mustache
* jQTouch (a modified version that contains only the touch event handling)


Samples
-------

You can download and try the sample apps:

__Browser App__

You just need to host the app (I use Dropbox for simplicity) and navigate to the index.html file in the root folder

__Android App__

Create a new Android project, the app uses some of the device features provided by PhoneGap 1.1.0
